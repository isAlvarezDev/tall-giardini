# Tall Giardini Project

This project is the result of modifying a code package provided as part of a challenge. The main objective was to analyze the structure and style of the original project and implement improvements in specific sections, as well as explore the integration of new components.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Installation**: Open your terminal in the project directory and run the following command to install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm i
    ```
    _(This command assumes you have pnpm installed. If not, you can install it globally with `npm install -g pnpm` or refer to the official pnpm documentation for installation instructions.)_

2.  **Astro Extension (Recommended)**: For the best development experience with Astro, it's recommended to install the official Astro extension for your code editor. This usually provides features like syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and more. You can find the Astro extension in your editor's marketplace (e.g., VS Code Marketplace).

3.  **Development Server**: Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    This command will usually start the project on a local development server (e.g., `http://localhost:4321`).

## Changes Made

The following modifications were implemented in the project:

* **"Tráfico sin conversión" Section (Component `TunnelSection` renamed to `TrafficInsights`)**:
    * The original `TunnelSection` component was renamed to `TrafficInsights` for better modularity and semantic clarity.
    * A new design and content were integrated, inspired by the "Unlock Your Team's Potential" section from the following reference: [https://suprema.framer.website/](https://suprema.framer.website/)
* **"Nuestra Solución" Section (New Component `TailoredSolutions`)**:
    * A new component named `TailoredSolutions` was created to replace the original section.
    * The design and content of this section were based on the "Our method is simple and transparent at every step, from zero to live." section from the following reference: [https://deliver.framer.website/](https://deliver.framer.website/)
    * A pulse effect was added to the component's title for emphasis.
    * A spotlight points animation was implemented for an engaging visual effect.
* **`Reviews` Component**:
    * The green background of the component was removed.
    * The color of the rating stars was changed to `#FEC84B` for better visual harmony with the rest of the design.
* **`ModelSection` Component**:
    * The background of the cards was modified to use a gradient, providing a more modern and dynamic look.
    * The same gradient effect was applied to the `handleMouseLeave` event to maintain visual consistency upon interaction.
    * The `font-medium` class was added to the card titles for greater visual emphasis.
* **`InfiniteMarquee` Component**:
    * The hover effect of the `<span>` containing the text "mejores herramientas" was modified.
* **`InfiniteMarqueeComponent` (in `App.tsx`)**:
    * The `InfiniteMarquee` component was wrapped within a `<div>` with `overflow: hidden` to enable the `TailoredSolutions` component to function correctly with a `sticky` scroll effect.
* **`Header` Component**:
    * The hover effect of the main button in the header was modified to improve visual interaction.

## External Templates and Fragments Used

* **"Tráfico sin conversión" Section (`TrafficInsights`):** Inspiration and design elements taken from the "Unlock Your Team's Potential" section at [https://suprema.framer.website/](https://suprema.framer.website/).
* **"Nuestra Solución" Section (`TailoredSolutions`):** Inspiration and design elements taken from the "Our method is simple and transparent at every step, from zero to live." section at [https://deliver.framer.website/](https://deliver.framer.website/).

## Next Steps (Optional)

* Explore more subtle animations for element interactions.
* Optimize responsiveness across different devices.
* Conduct usability testing to validate the implemented improvements.
